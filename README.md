# More Filter SQL Query
<h>Introduction</h2>
In this lab, you’ll apply more filters to SQL queries to retrieve information from a database. You’ll use common operators in SQL to filter by specific dates and times. You’ll be using the MariaDB shell to run your SQL queries.

<h2>What you’ll do</h2>
You have multiple tasks in this lab: 

 - Filter for login attempts made after a certain date
 - Filter for login attempts made in a certain date range
 - Filter for login attempts made at a certain time
 - Filter for login attempts by ID

<h2>Scenario</h2>
In this scenario, you’re investigating a recent security incident.

You need to gather information about login attempts for certain dates and times. This will help in resolving a security incident.

Here’s how you’ll do this task: First, you’ll retrieve login events made after a certain date. Second, you’ll narrow the focus of the search to filter logins in a date range. Third, you’ll investigate logins that were made at certain times. Finally, you’ll filter login attempts based on their event IDs.
